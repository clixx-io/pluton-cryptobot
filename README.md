# Pluton Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

This bot is a fork of https://github.com/bwentzloff/trading-bot by User bwentzloff

This is learning tool and the current State is Experimental. 

The characteristics that make this Bot different is that it uses Meshs as overlays for predictive
Buy/Sell/Hold Actions. Many other bots use simple Candlestick Methods but the Algorithms
here use General Mood and Meshs such as Star Patterns, Moon Patterns, Paydays and Weekends
for predictive modelling. After all, we are all people and these things affect us and
our Buying and Selling Moods.

Backtesting is supported using the Poloniex API. More backtesting and using other exchanges and live trading are planned.

Backtesting can be run using the following command:
`python backtest.py`
